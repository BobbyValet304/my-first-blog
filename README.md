# my-first-blog

The motivation for this project is to provide a simple interface to the public to post their opinions in one central location.
I built this project to aid the public and free speech. This project solves the problem of going from one site to another in order to voice your opinion.
I learned the Document Object Model, how to traverse it, how to set attributes and append them to the document. I learned about numerous events and prevent default browser behavior. My project stands out because I have used unique solutions to solve old problems.
